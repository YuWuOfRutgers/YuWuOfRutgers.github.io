I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, working with [Prof. Anand Sarwate](https://adsarwate.github.io). I earned my Master's degree in Electronic Engineering and Information Science in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Bin Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kReWULQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and my Bachelor's degree in Information Security in 2017, both from the University of Science and Technology of China(USTC).

My research interests lie in efficient AI (Learning with reject option and Dyna-Style Model-Based RL), Human activity recognition (inductive sensing and WiFi-based recognition) and LLM reasoning (In-context Learning and reversal curse).

Beyond Research
------
I am passionate about any outdoor activity like camping (both car-camping and backpack), cycling and hiking. I have three lovely cats. Unfortunately, they don't like going outside with me :(
